Cartpole Deep Q Learning: Machine Learning & Bioinspired Optimisation

The code for our network is written in Python, in the notebook format.
This filetype can either be opening in your Jupyter Notebook Environment, or in Google Co-Lab. 

We recommend using Jupyter as this allows for video rendering of the gameplay, along with properly displaying the additional information we've included in the notebook. 

To run the code, go to the Kernel tab and select 'restart and run all'.
